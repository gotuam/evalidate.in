              <p align="justify"><font size="2">The Institute has introduced a scheme of innovative and comprehensive education at university and non-university general and technical education levels which aims at excellence but not at the cost of the relevance, which inculcates dignity of labour, encourages initiative and creative work, which is multi-disciplinary, which prepares men for the increasingly techno-oriented society of tomorrow without uprooting them from their agricultural moorings, which will generate in the alumni the basic values of humanism, secularism and democracy by exposing them to the principles of all the major religions of the world and to their own cultural heritage, thus developing in them an integrated personality of well-adjusted men whose world has not been broken into fragments by narrow domestic walls.</font></p>

Administered by a Managing Committee registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860, the Institute, since the very beginning, combined the pursuit of academic studies with sensibilities, moral and spiritual values. From the modest beginning, the nucleus not only grew and got divided but also spawned new institutions, as the needs of the society and the times demanded. Within six months, it was raised to the level of a High School; Intermediate classes were started in 1922; it became a Degree College in 1947, with the introduction of B.Com. classes affiliated to Agra University; B.Ed. (B.T.) classes were added in 1951 and the first batch of B.Sc. students was sent up for the final examination in 1955.</font></p>

<font size="2" align="justify">A new and significant development of far-reaching consequence, in the history of education at Dayalbagh, was the establishment of DAYALBAGH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE as a registered body in 1973, which integrated and brought under one umbrella all the educational institutions of Dayalbagh, including the School of Comparative Study of Religion, the School of Languages and the School of Art and Culture.</font></p>

   <p align="justify"><font size="2"> Dayalbagh Educational Institute has set forth a bold goal for itself: to become one of the top 20 educational institutions in the country by the year 2011. Keeping in line with the original philosophy of education at Dayalbagh, this goal set forth for the institute envisions making D.E.I. a top teaching-cum-research institute, leading others forward with the exemplary system of education that integrates (K-U) i.e. K through 12 through UG/PG to Ph.D. programmes. Education at DEI will reflect a rare combination of state-of-the-art knowledge woven into a fabric that inculcates dignity of labour, and stresses creative multi-disciplinary work experience, cultural and agricultural moorings, and basic values of humanism, secularism and democracy. In fact, Vision 2011 envisages that a major spin-off of DEI's effort to move into the top 20 institutions in India will be its recognition at international fronts for its excellence in instruction and research, within its special social, moral, and spiritual framework.</font></p>
